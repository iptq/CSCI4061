I have familiarized myself with the contents of the CSCI 4061 syllabus
and agree to abide by the policies contained within it. I will obey
the PRIME DIRECTIVE. I understand that the Kauffman section of 4061
(001) is not coordinated with the Tripathi section (010) and will not
seek or render unauthorized help from students or staff in that
section. As a University of Minnesota student, I agree to follow the
Student Code of Conduct and will treat my classmates and the course
staff with honest respect.

Signed,
Michael Zhang
